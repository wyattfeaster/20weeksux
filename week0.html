		<h1>Week 0 - A Brief Overview</h1>
		</article><br><br>
		<h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
		<p>As my BFA project at Eastern Washington University I will solve 20 problems, over 20 weeks using user experience and human centered design approaches. Over the course of the next 20 weeks I will be taking a look at user experience design in a broader spectrum. In order to achieve an in-depth study, a variety of approaches will be conducted. Each week will variety in the complexity of the problem and the solution presented. Reasearch, interviews, user testing and field studies apart of this experiment. I will be documenting the steps and findings that I come across. </p><br>

		<h2>USER EXPERIENCE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ME?</h2>
		<p>When I think of User experience (UX from here on out) the first thing that comes to my mind is the way in which we interact and experience our devices. This includes things like phones, computers, and any other digital piece of equipment. But when we take a step back and really think about UX, it is much more then that. UX is all around, from filling up our water to purchasing clothing in a store. For example, trying to put oil into a car without a funnel is a bad user experience. The funnel makes the experience of putting oil into your car a good one. Everything we do in life has some sort of experience in it. We only remember the bad ones. This is one of the best quotes I have heard.</p>

<blockquote>“Good design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it.” <br> – Jared Spool</blockquote>
