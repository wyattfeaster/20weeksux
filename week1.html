		<h1>WEEK 1 - Checkout Experience</h1>
		<br><br>
	<div>
		<h2>PROBLEM: Baldy's checkout becomes painfully slow during lunch hours.</h2>

		<h2> A Few Findings</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>I went through the checkout process to discover that the lines really back up one of the reasons I had found this to be true was the fast that many customers had to weigh their food at the checkout creating extra time. </li><br>
			<li>I noticed was that many people do not have food that required it to be weighed on a scale.</li><br>
			<li>Receipts take a long time to print out becuase of slow credit card machines</li><br>
			<li>Long waits often lead customers with few items, to put there items back </li><br>
		</ol>
		<h2>Reasearch</h2>
		<p>One of the biggest themes found through reasearch was that the checkout process should be easy, quick, and simple. Peoples time is very valuable in our fast passed world.<br>
		60% of people abandon their purchases because of a bad customer experience<br>
		Customers do not like unexpected costs at the register.</p>
		<h2> Brainstorming</h2>

		<h2> Solution 1 - Express Lane for people who don't need to have food weighed</h2>
		<p>The express lane would allow for customers without food items that require weighing to go to a faster line. This would both reduce line sizes, and would speed up checkout.</p>

		<h2> Solution 2 - Seperate weigh station</h2>
		<p>Creating seperate weigh statation would improve the flow of speed of checkout lines. Customers that need to have food weighed would be able to do so before checkout. A bar code would be given to them. This would speed up lines at checkout.</p>
